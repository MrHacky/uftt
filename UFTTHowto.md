# Sharing Stuff #

There are 3 methods to share something with uftt:
  * Drag and drop something from explorer (or another file manager) into the Share List table (works for files and directories).
  * Click the "Add Share (dir)..." button and select what you want to share (only works for directories).
  * Click the "Add Share (file)..." button and select what you want to share (only works for files).

# Downloading Stuff #

First, make sure your download location (in the editbox labeled "To:") is set up correctly, either by entering it there directly or selecting it via the "Browse..." button.

If the share you want to download is not yet in the share list, try clicking the "Refresh" button.

Now doubleclick the share, or select it and press the "Download" button, to start the download.
