=== ramblings about design ===

Just some thinking about the (distant?) future of UFTT :-p

Some concepts might need to be introduced for extensibility etc: 
  * link = some particular way to communicate with other clients
    examples: a connected TCP-connection
              an IPX/UDP broadcast interface
              an IPX/UDP p2p semi-connection
              a multicast connection
  * a single client process can be connected to another client process via multiple links
    examples: both udp and tcp connection over same ethernet cable
              both wired and wireless connection
  * these links will not be 'special' and will be handles just as if they
    had different endpoint clients
  * a method might be needed to mark links as being bundled over the same hardware
      (sharing bandwidth etc)
    , but this is independent of whether the links are for the same endpoint or not
  * would be really need if that could be autodetected to some usually sensible defaults :-)

Other stuff to think about:
  * multiple links may share the same network backend?
  * broadcast links always available, even without known endpoints
  * links can have more than 1 endpoint (broadcast, multicast)
  * broadcast links can 'discover' endpoints by themselves
